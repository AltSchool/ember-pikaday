ember-pikaday is an addon that can be installed with Ember CLI. It gives you a datepicker input component that can be used in your Ember.js application. Pikaday and Moment.js are used in the background so they are added as Bower dependencies to your application.

**The component provided by ember-pikaday is fully acceptance tested.**

## Installation

```bash
cd your-project-directory
npm install --save-dev ember-pikaday
ember g ember-pikaday
```

## Usage

While the input shows a formatted date to the user the bound attribute is always a JavaScript date object. If the application sets the attribute without a user interaction the datepicker updates accordingly.

```handlebars
<label>
  Start date:
  {{pikaday-input value=startsAt}}
</label>
```

You can also change the default format from `DD.MM.YYYY` to any format string supported by Moment.js.

```handlebars
<label>
  Start date:
  {{pikaday-input value=startsAt format="MM/DD/YYYY"}}
</label>
```
